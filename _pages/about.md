My name is **Juan Haladjian** and I am a post-doctoral researcher at the [Chair for Applied Software Engineering](https://ase.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/) at the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de/) headed by [Prof. Bernd Brügge](https://ase.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/people/52-professor).

## Research Interests
I conduct research in the fields of wearable, mobile and ubiquitous technologies, activity recognition, human-computer interaction and software engineering. Please visit my [publication page](/publications) to find out more about my research. 

## Brief Bio
I was originally born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I moved to Barcelona when I was 17 year-old and obained a Bachelor's degree in computer science at the [Pompeu Fabra University](www.upf.edu) with honors and an award to the highest grades of the 2009-promotion. I then moved to Germany where I studied [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/fuer-studierende/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/) at the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de/) with the financial support of a fellowship from the [Fundación Caja Madrid](https://www.fundacionmontemadrid.es/). In 2011, before finishing my Master program, I met Prof. Brügge at a [summer school](https://www.ferienakademie.de/en/home-2/), who offered me to do a Ph.D. at his research group. I obtained my doctoral degree in software engineering with a focus on ubiquitous technologies and human-computer interaction in 2016 with *suma cum laude*. Driven by different exciting research ideas I could not finish during my Ph.D., I decided to stay for three more years at the department and pursue a Habilitation (the highest degree attainablein Germany). During my professional career, I obtained different [awards](/cv) and published [my research](/publications) at top [scientific conferences](/talks).

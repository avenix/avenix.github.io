I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple, previously post-doctoral researcher at the [Chair for Applied Software Engineering](https://ase.in.tum.de/lehrstuhl_1/) at the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de/). I have over 15 years experience conducting research in data-centric machine learning.

## Research Interests
My current research area is on efficient data annotation. I work on methods to 1) **save annotation costs**, e.g. using models in the annotation loop,  semi-supervised learning or active learning and 2) **improve annotation quality**, e.g. with consensus and ensemble methods to aggregate annotations from multiple graders or more advanced methods, such as LLM as a judge. Previously, I worked on activity recognition methods for devices with limited compute capabilities such as wearable and mobile devices. 


## Brief Bio
I obained a Bachelor's degree in computer science at the [Pompeu Fabra University](www.upf.edu) with honors and an award to the highest grades of the 2009-promotion. I then moved to Germany where I studied [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/fuer-studierende/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/) at the [Technical University of Munich](http://www.tum.de/) with the financial support of a fellowship from the [Fundación Caja Madrid](https://www.fundacionmontemadrid.es/). I obtained my doctoral degree in software engineering with a focus on machine learning for wearable devices in 2016 with *suma cum laude*. Driven by different exciting research ideas I could not finish during my Ph.D., I did a four year post-doc and obtained a Habilitation (highest degree attainable in Germany). During my professional career, I obtained different [awards](/cv) and published [my research](/publications) at top [scientific conferences](/talks). I joined Apple in 2020 and I am still loving working here.
